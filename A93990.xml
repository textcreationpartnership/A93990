            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>On the third of <hi>October</hi> laÅ¿t paÅ¿t at the Town of <hi>PoÅ¿en,</hi> and round about for above ten miles diÅ¿tance from thence, about five of the Clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was Å¿een the perfect appearance of two great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the Air: The Sky was very clear and Å¿carce a Cloud to be Å¿een above the Horizon. One of the Armies Å¿tood towards the EaÅ¿t, the other to the WeÅ¿t, faceing each other, both drawn up exactly in Battadia, and appearing Å¿o viÅ¿ibly that the Å¿pectators could diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h the HorÅ¿e and Foot, diÅ¿cern the Several Brigades, and plainly Å¿ee their Trains of Artillery: ThoÅ¿e that firÅ¿t view'd this Å¿trange Å¿ight Å¿ummon their Neighbours to admire it, and in an hours Å¿pace peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are Alarm'd round the Countrey, who get out of their Beds and HouÅ¿es, and with trembling behold this amazeing prodigy, which added more to their terror, when haveing appeared Å¿ome time in that poÅ¿ture, as braveing each other, both Armies on a Å¿udden ruÅ¿ht forwards with a Violent motion, and Å¿eem'd to meet and moÅ¿t furiouÅ¿ly engage each other, whereupon they heard whole Vallies of Cannons diÅ¿charg'd, and peals of musket Å¿hot, continually playing for above an hour; accompanied all that time with hideons Cries, and Å¿hreeks, howlings, Å¿ometimes like the Å¿hreeks of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Children, and at other times like that of men wounded, and giveing up their laÅ¿t Breath in Dying Groans.</p>
            <p>This diÅ¿mal Airial Conflict continued with much fury till Sun-riÅ¿ing, both parties being Å¿o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:137088:4"/> that it was impoÅ¿Å¿ible to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h which had the Victory, the whole Heavens appeared of a crimÅ¿on-dye, and overÅ¿pread with blood: and the continual FlaÅ¿hes made it Å¿eem like the Day of Doom, when the whole World Å¿hall become a Prey to the Element of Fire: It is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to imagine (much leÅ¿s expreÅ¿s) the ConÅ¿ternation of the People, who by thouÅ¿ands Å¿tood to behold this wonderful Spectacle, where their eyes and ears Encountred nothing but objects of Terror: At laÅ¿t the Sun being got above the Horizon, cauÅ¿ed all theÅ¿e Warlike PhantaÅ¿ms to diÅ¿apear, and Å¿oon after, the noiÅ¿e ceaÅ¿ed, and the Heavens put on their former friendly Countenance, which yet cannot wipe out thoÅ¿e ruful Characters of Fear, Affrightment, and DiÅ¿pair, imprinted on the dejected viÅ¿ages of the Spectators by this Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of Horror.</p>
            <p>About a week after, at Noon-day, no Cloud, Storm, or TempeÅ¿t appearing nigh, a moÅ¿t terrible Fiery red hot Bullet was obÅ¿erved by hundreds of people, to paÅ¿s through the Air a little higher than the tops of their houÅ¿es, but of a very vaÅ¿t bigneÅ¿s, and making a Å¿trange kind of hiÅ¿Å¿ing in its paÅ¿Å¿age, yet doing no hurt, but flying Å¿o Å¿everal miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly <hi>EaÅ¿t;</hi> at laÅ¿t with a mighty noiÅ¿e, as if it would have rent the earth, it burÅ¿t into a thouÅ¿and pieces, which flaming and fluttering a while in the Air, vaniÅ¿ht.</p>
            <p>Several other Å¿trange and prodigious Å¿ights have lately manifeÅ¿ted themÅ¿elves in divers parts of that Kingdom, the particulars whereof we Å¿hall here o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and only obÅ¿erve that the fore-recited Aparen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could not be the vain Chimera's of wanton Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or depraved Conceits of melancholly heads, as

            <p>Let us not place God's immediate miraculous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions to the account of common Secundary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, nor argue againÅ¿t the reality of their Aparence, till we Å¿mart under the fury of their Significations, God has two fair Volumes, whereby he reveals his pleaÅ¿ure to the Sons of men, his Word, and his Works; Å¿ometimes he wooes us by the one, and Å¿ometimes warns us by the other: and thoÅ¿e that will neither obey his moÅ¿t profitable Precepts, nor regard his merciful Threatnings, deÅ¿ervedly become Objects of his Å¿evere JuÅ¿tice: who then Å¿ets up cruel and barbarous Nations (as Rods of his Anger) to Å¿courge them that vainly pride themÅ¿elves in the Title o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
